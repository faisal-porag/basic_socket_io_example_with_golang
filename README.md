##### Basic socket.io example with Golang

> Basic server/client communication with `socket.io` using Golang Example 

`Socket.IO` is a popular JavaScript library that enables real-time, bidirectional communication between clients 
(usually browsers) and servers. It is often used for building interactive web applications, online multiplayer games, 
chat applications, collaborative tools, and more.

Here are some of the benefits of using `Socket.IO`:

- `Real-time Communication:` 
`Socket.IO` facilitates real-time communication by establishing a persistent connection between the client and the server. 
This allows data to be transmitted instantly without the need for constant polling or manual refreshing of the page.

- `Bidirectional Communication:`
Unlike traditional HTTP requests, which are unidirectional (client to server), `Socket.IO` enables bidirectional 
communication, meaning both the client and server can initiate communication and exchange data at any time.

- `Event-Based Architecture:`
`Socket.IO` uses an event-driven architecture. Clients and servers can emit and listen for events, making it easy 
to organize and manage different types of interactions and actions in your application.

- `Cross-Browser Compatibility:`
`Socket.IO` abstracts away many of the complexities of working with WebSockets, providing a consistent API that 
works across different browsers and devices. It uses various transport mechanisms (WebSockets, long polling, etc.) 
to ensure compatibility in different scenarios.

- `Fallback Mechanisms:`
In cases where WebSockets are not supported by the client or the network, `Socket.IO` can automatically switch to 
other transport mechanisms like long polling, ensuring that real-time communication still functions.

- `Scalability:`
`Socket.IO` supports horizontal scaling by allowing you to distribute connections across multiple instances of
your server. This is crucial for applications that need to handle a large number of concurrent users.

- `Rooms and Namespaces:`
`Socket.IO` provides the concept of rooms and namespaces, which allow you to organize clients and events into 
logical groups. This is useful for scenarios where you want to send messages to specific subsets of clients.

- `Broadcasting and Notifications:`
Applications can broadcast messages to multiple clients simultaneously. This is useful for sending notifications to 
all users, updating multiple clients with the same data, or coordinating actions among different users.

- `Middleware Support:`
Similar to popular web frameworks, `Socket.IO` supports middleware, allowing you to intercept and modify events as 
they pass between clients and the server. This can be used for tasks like authentication, data validation, or logging.

- `Community and Documentation:`
`Socket.IO` has a large and active community, which means you can find a wealth of resources, tutorials, and libraries 
to extend its functionality. The official documentation is comprehensive and well-maintained.

- `Ease of Use:`
`Socket.IO's` API is designed to be relatively simple and easy to understand, making it accessible for both beginners 
and experienced developers.

Overall, Socket.IO is a powerful tool for adding real-time capabilities to web applications, making it easier to 
build engaging and interactive experiences for users.

ensure that changes made by one user are reflected to others instantly.

- `Live Polls and Voting:`
Events, conferences, and interactive presentations often use `Socket.IO` to conduct live polls and gather real-time 
feedback from the audience.

- `Ride-Sharing and Navigation Apps:`
Real-time ride-sharing services and navigation apps use `Socket.IO` to provide users with instant updates on driver 
locations, ride requests, and routes.

- `Customer Support and Help Desks:`
Live customer support chat applications benefit from `Socket.IO's` ability to deliver messages between users and 
support agents in real time.

- `Online Education and Webinars:`
Platforms that host webinars, online classes, or virtual meetings can use `Socket.IO` to facilitate real-time interactions
between instructors and participants.

Here's a basic example of a production-level server-client application using `Socket.IO` in Go (Golang). 
This example demonstrates how to set up a simple chat server and client using the `go.socket.io` library for Socket.IO.

- `Install Dependencies:`
You'll need to install the go.socket.io library using the following command:
```shell
go get github.com/googollee/go-socket.io
```

- `Server (main.go):`
```shell
package main

import (
	"log"
	"net/http"
	
	socketio "github.com/googollee/go-socket.io"
)

func main() {
	server, err := socketio.NewServer(nil)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}

	server.OnConnect("/", func(s socketio.Conn) error {
		log.Println("Client connected:", s.ID())
		return nil
	})

	server.OnEvent("/", "chat message", func(s socketio.Conn, msg string) {
		log.Println("Message received:", msg)
		server.BroadcastToRoom("/", "chat", "chat message", msg)
	})

	http.Handle("/socket.io/", server)
	http.Handle("/", http.FileServer(http.Dir("./public")))

	log.Println("Server started at :5000")
	log.Fatal(http.ListenAndServe(":5000", nil))
}
```

- `Client (public/index.html):`
Create a directory named "public" in the same directory as your server.go and inside that directory, 
create an index.html file:

```shell
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Socket.IO Chat</title>
  <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/socket.io/4.0.1/socket.io.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <ul id="messages"></ul>
  <form id="form" action="">
    <input id="input" autocomplete="off" /><button>Send</button>
  </form>
  
  <script>
    const socket = io();

    const form = document.getElementById('form');
    const input = document.getElementById('input');
    const messages = document.getElementById('messages');

    form.addEventListener('submit', function(e) {
      e.preventDefault();
      if (input.value) {
        socket.emit('chat message', input.value);
        input.value = '';
      }
    });

    socket.on('chat message', function(msg) {
      const item = document.createElement('li');
      item.textContent = msg;
      messages.appendChild(item);
      window.scrollTo(0, document.body.scrollHeight);
    });
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

- `Run the Application:`
Run the server using the following command:
```shell
go run main.go
```

Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000. You can open multiple tabs or browsers to 
simulate different clients. As you type messages in the input field and hit `Send` the messages will be broadcast to 
all connected clients in real-time.
